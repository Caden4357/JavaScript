# Focus for today is synthetic events

## synthetic events are just like events in regular JS some minor differences but think of them as the same 

## Go over some of the common synthetic events on the platform 

## Show them off. Easiest approach is to probably start with a simple onClick alert then move to manipulating something with an onClick if you didnt get to increase album sales in last lecture now is probably the best time with this explain hooks and specifically the useState hook 

## Just allows us to "hook" or grab some data and easily manipulate it. Explain the getter and setter idea

## Props is great for passing data (remember props can only be passed from parent to child) state is used for updating or changing things you can set your state to something passed in from props and manipulate it through state. Your essentially making a copy of that data that has a setter method/function attached to it that allows it to change 

## Remeber react components are functions that run once or whenever the page is refreshed but in react we avoid refreshes because of the design 

## State is how we get around that in a way. Props are immutable 

## Between increasing album sales and changeHeader you should have plenty of content to cover
