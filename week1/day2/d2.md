# Focus today is intro to react and components 

# Reminder: Use inspect/react dev tool often!!!

### 1.) After slide deck show todo list in vanilla JS and then in React to show off the difference and why we use React. Also use this time to draw out a component tree make connections with virtual DOM and SPA

### 2.) Lets backtrack now and run npx create-react-app <name> (I just recreate the simple todo code I showed in step 1)
### lets break down some of what just happened mention gitignore and to NOT upload or submit node-modules

### 3.) We are creating components which act as pieces that make up our webpage with JS functions returning back JSX which is essentially a JS HTML hybrid really cool! Pretty soon we will be making these more dynamic with props and state its very easy to duplicate these functions, or componets which is what we call them, and make them unique


### 4.) "Syntactic sugar" Show babel with the boilerplate app.js code

### 5.) Delete boilerplate app.js code make sure to mention className instead of class and htmlFor instead of for 

### 6.) Start building out todo component explain that JSX can only return 1 element that doesnt mean only one HTML tag per component we can use a fragment or a div 

### 7.) Start showing props and make the connection that we are just passing in parameters to our component which is just a function and that is keys in an object called props short for properties 

### 8.) If time destructure props

## 9.) wrap up points 

## 10.) plan for tomorrow
